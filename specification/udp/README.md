This project uses [K3PO](http://github.com/k3po/k3po) to help UDP Protocol 
[RFC-768](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) implementations automate their verification of the necessary specification requirements.

Note: all testing of the UDP protocol is done above what is provided by the OS/Java stack, thus the semantics of udp protocol are currently not tested in this project
